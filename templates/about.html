          My name is Bruce (Jitian Liang) and I'm currently a Master of IT (Software Engineering) student at UTS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I finished my Civil Engineering bachelor degree and worked in construction industry in Sydney for 2 years, and
          in 2022 I decided to transfer to Software Engineering after careful consideration. So far I have been enjoying
          this journey very much by learning and coding new stuffs every day, although sometimes it is really
          frustrating to fix bugs or trying to improve my code :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than coding, I'm also keen on sports, especially golf‚õ≥ and basketballüèÄ. If you are around Sydney or you
          share some same interests with me, feel free to contact me via Twitter/ Facebook/ Email through the Contact page.
